This project is created following the Radu Mariescu-Istodor (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUjN2Mln_Gg), using VanillaJS to create a self driving car on a web page.
THe project is still a work in progress. The getIntersection() function does not work properly, and the car has no working collision system (yet!).
All the documentation and comments are in Spanish, if someone was interested i would be glad to translate it (although this program is more of a challenge to myself).
